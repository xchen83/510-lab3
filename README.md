# TECHIN 510 Lab 3

## Overview
This is an grocery shopping list app, allowing users to keep track of what groceries they need to purchase.
Data storage and retrieval using Python.

## Installation
Install the follwing:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install streamlit
pip install pydantic
pip install streamlit-pydantic
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install psycopg2
```

## Usage

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Lessions Learned
In this lab, I have learned how to use the streamlit to create a form which includes the function of dropdown menu, checkbox, toggles, and fields. I also learned how to use sqlite to store the data locally from the users' input and making changes of the list through the "Edit" and "Delete" button by using the pydantic.


## Questions / Improvements
Question:
Can I use the same resource group for multiple apps?

Future Improvements:
Future improvements could be made to incorporate images to the app.
